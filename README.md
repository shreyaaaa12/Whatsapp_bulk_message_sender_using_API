# Whatsapp_bulk_message_sender_using_API
This is minor web development project which allows you to send messages on WhatsApp using a website which uses Twilio whatsapp API in the backend. We can send multiple messages to multiple users using this API.
This project is designed for medium to large companies that want to use WhatsApp with
multiple users. It is more complex than WhatsApp Business App. For instance,
WhatsApp API has no app or front-end interface and needs to be integrated into a
business software.
